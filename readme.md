**Welcome**

Make sure that if you rename the folder before placing the folder onto your servers web root, that you change the directory name in the config.php to match what the new folder name is.

Modifications made to make backend object oriented, and unit testing as well as end to end testing added for the module. I used AngularJS 1, jQuery and Jasmine for the unit and end to end testing, and finally PHP (with legacy sytnax for arrays in case you try to run on a system with an older PHP installation).

I really took my time to and showed off just a bit :) I hope you enjoy!
